Your task is to program a multiclass classifier using the attached data. Follow these steps:

**Data preprocessing:**
Appropriately preprocess the data so that it is ready for convolutional neural network (CNN) training.

**Convolutional Neural Network Design:**
Design and implement a convolutional neural network to use for data classification.

**Data distribution:**
Divide the data into training, validation and test sets. Choose the appropriate split ratio.

**Training and validation:**
Train the model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
Plot the course of training and validation for the accuracy and loss metrics.

**Testing and evaluation:**
Test the model on the test set.
Construct a confusion matrix for the results on the test set.
Calculate the metrics F1 score, recall (sensitivity), precision and overall accuracy of the model.

**Presentation of results:**
For your defense, bring working code that implements all of the above steps.

> Remember to make sure that the code is clear and well documented, which will make it easier to understand and present.

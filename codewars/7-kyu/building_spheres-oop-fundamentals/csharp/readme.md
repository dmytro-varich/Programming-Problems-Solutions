Now that we have a [Block](http://www.codewars.com/kata/55b75fcf67e558d3750000a3) let's move on to something slightly more complex: a `Sphere`.

# Arguments for the constructor
```
radius -> integer
mass -> integer
```

# Methods to be defined
```
GetRadius()       =>  radius of the Sphere
GetMass()         =>  mass of the Sphere
GetVolume()       =>  volume of the Sphere (a double rounded to 5 place after the decimal)
GetSurfaceArea()  =>  surface area of the Sphere (a double rounded to 5 place after the decimal)
GetDensity()      =>  density of the Sphere (a double rounded to 5 place after the decimal)
```

# Example
```
Sphere ball = new Sphere(2,50)
ball.GetRadius() ->       2
ball.GetMass() ->         50
ball.GetVolume() ->       33.51032
ball.GetSurfaceArea() ->  50.26548
ball.GetDensity() ->      1.49208
```
Any feedback would be much appreciated

My initial implementation, characterized by complexity involving loops and multiple conditions, is deemed less efficient. However, I discovered a more effective and concise solution that adheres to best practices. The improved code utilizes the `String.Format` method for hexadecimal formatting, resulting in enhanced simplicity and readability.

```
using System;

public class Kata
{
    public static string Rgb(int r, int g, int b) 
    {
        r = Math.Max(Math.Min(255, r), 0);
        g = Math.Max(Math.Min(255, g), 0);
        b = Math.Max(Math.Min(255, b), 0);
        return String.Format("{0:X2}{1:X2}{2:X2}", r, g, b);
    }
}
```
